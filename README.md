# Advent of Code 2021

I know I'm quite a bit late to the party on this one &ndash; it couldn't
even be "Christmas in July" at this point &ndash; but I would really like
to be able to complete one of these calendars at some point.

I've attempted previous ones in JavaScript, PureScript, and Haskell, but,
so far, I've always dropped it somewhere in the middle. I'm going to take
another swing at it, this time in Rust.
